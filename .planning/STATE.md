### Blockers/Concerns

- OpenHTMLtoPDF version (1.1.22) and API surface need verification against current Maven Central before writing POM
- CSS `column-count` in paged media has MEDIUM confidence -- may need table-based fallback for Template B
- CSS `@page` margin boxes with `running()` elements have MEDIUM confidence -- running headers/footers may need iteration
